# README for Module 14 Challenge (belly-button-challenge)

## Introduction

This challenge creates an interactive dashboard using `JavaScript` and `d3` and `Leaflet` libraries. The challenge examines a "Belly Button Biodiversity" dataset, looking specifically at common microbial species.

## Data

The data consists a JSON file (samples.json). This file is located in the main directory in this repository (belly-button-challenge). However, the JSON is retrieved from a API or URL [here][("https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json").

## Methodology

This challenge involves using MongoDM, Mongosh, and mostly Pymongo. These tools enable the import of the JSON file into MongoDB, and Python to parse the JSON file. Pymongo is used extensively to query and edit the data. Finally Pandas is also used to create DataFrames for ease of viewing the data.

## Results

The results show a wide range of hygiene and rating values across the United Kingdom. Several DataFrames are created to present the data clearly and concisely.

## Conclusion

The establishment we added in Part 1 ('Penang Flavours') is relatively close to many restaurants with good hygiene. There may be some competition for them, and should try to keep hygiene standards high to stay competitive.
